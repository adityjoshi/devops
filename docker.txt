Docker Container - A docker container is nothing but an running instance of an image.

Docker Image - It is nothing but the blueprint of the app. It contains -:
    - the base os i.e. ubantu,go, python etc
    - the dependencies and libraries that are needed 
    - application code
    - command that runs the container

Every image is made up of layers, which are like a stack of file system changes.

FROM python:3.12-slim     ← layer 1 (base)
COPY app.py .              ← layer 2 (adds your file)
RUN pip install flask      ← layer 3 (installs dependencies)
CMD ["python", "app.py"]   ← layer 4 (defines what to run)

Each layer is cached, if nothing is changed docker uses the same for the faster build instead of re-building.




2. Dockerfile 

- It is the set of instructions that we provide to docker to tell how to build the Image.
- The instructions are executed top to bottom

Instructions                  Meaning 

FROM                          Base image must always be the first
WORKDIR                       set the working dir inside the container
COPY                          copy files form your host to the container 
RUN                           execute the command during the build
CMD                           set the default command when the container starts
EXPOSE                        inform the docker to which port the container will listen to 
ENV                           set the env variables inside the container






3. Build Layes and Context

docker build -t my-app .
  
    - the dot in the command takes all files from your current directory and sent to the docker daemon.
    - it reads the instructions from the dockerfile and executes as a new layer





4. Difference betweent the cmd and entrypoint
  
    - entrypoint : it used when something is fixed and always run and doesn't change often. Like a python interprator will always run first before the actual python file.
    - cmd : it is used where we set some dummy command that can be overridden in the future too.
